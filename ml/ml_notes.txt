Notes for improvements I have to make in my ML frameworks:

- Make new constructors for `gml::tensor<T>`, `gml::matrix<T>` and `gml::vector<T>` that construct them with the given
  dimensions, but do not default-initialise values, as this is expensive and should only be performed if necessary
- Add more activation functions
- Add more loss functions
